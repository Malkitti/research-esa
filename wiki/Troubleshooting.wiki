=== Latin-1 / UTF-8 /Binary encoding

==== Problem ====

When comparing two texts with demo.ComputeESASimilarity, the wikipedia database must be on latin1 charset in order to get a semantic similarity score between the two texts. However, I wanted to work with a full wikipedia database (which in english its supposed to have around 3 million pages), so I created the database via  [http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki Mediawiki] engine, which doesn't support anymore latin-1 databases. Your only options are an utf-8 binary charset database or a plain utf8 one. I tried to calculate semantic similarity with both, but demo.ComputeESASimilarity always gave ESA = 0.0000. 

==== *partial* solution ==== 
I dumped wikimedia mysql database schema using {{{ mysqldump --nodata }}} and with sed I changed the charset and collation specifications to latin-1. Then I imported again the [http://dumps.wikimedia.org/enwiki/20110405/ wikipedia dumps]
